# BicycleRace

This map is a project from my Graphic Design - Cartography course at UW-Madison. The objective was to create a shaded relief map for a fictional bicycle race using ArcMap and Adobe Creative Suite products. In addition to learning how to successfully manipulate elevation data for shaded relief, this project provided a fantastic opportunity for me to develop my Adobe Creative Suite skills.
